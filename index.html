        <p>My favourite hobby is cycling. It is the easiest way to travel when we have to go to the near by places in our locality. Riding bicycle is also a good exercise. Cycling improves strength, balance and coordination. It may also help to prevent falls and fractures. Riding a bike is an ideal form of exercise if you have osteoarthritis, because it is a low-impact exercise that places little stress on joints. </p>
